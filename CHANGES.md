# NUnit Analyzers 4.11.1 - October 30, 2025

This release of the NUnit Analyzers fixes a regression related to the analysis of nullable enum parameters in
`NUnit1001` and `NUnit1031`. The release also contains a new analyzer and codefix for unnecessary usage of lambda
expressions in asserts.

The release contains contributions from the following users (in alphabetical order):
* @MaceWindu
* @maksim-sovkov
* @manfred-brands

Issues Resolved

Features and Enhancements
* #927 Add new rule for unnecessary use of lambda expressions

Bugs
* #939 NUnit1001 - false positive for arguments with nullable enum parameters
* #938 [NUnit1031] False positive for nullable structs


# NUnit Analyzers 4.11 - October 28, 2025

This release of the NUnit Analyzers includes improvements and fixes related to `IDisposable` handling and initialization 
in `SetUp` and `OneTimeSetUp` methods. It also introduces the ability to configure additional methods that should be 
treated as `SetUp` and `TearDown` methods by the analyzers. This can be done in the `.editorconfig`, and there are four 
configurations for this:

* `dotnet_diagnostic.NUnit.additional_setup_methods`
* `dotnet_diagnostic.NUnit.additional_teardown_methods`
* `dotnet_diagnostic.NUnit.additional_one_time_setup_methods`
* `dotnet_diagnostic.NUnit.additional_one_time_teardown_methods`

Each configuration accepts a list of method names, separated by commas, semicolons, or spaces. For example:

```ini
dotnet_diagnostic.NUnit.additional_setup_methods = CustomSetup, MyInit
```

As in recent releases, a major part of this work was contributed by @manfred-brands.

`Assert.Multiple`/`Assert.MultipleAsync` into the new `Assert.EnterMultipleScope` format, as well
as for converting `is T` checks into `Is.InstanceOf<T>()` constraints.

For `NUnit2021`, the analyzer now respects `UsingPropertiesComparer`, including enhancements
that will be available in NUnit 4.4.

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds a new diagnostic `NUnit1034` that checks
whether base TestFixtures are declared as `abstract`. When a base class is not `abstract` 
it will also be run as a standalone test which is most times not the intention.

now split into separate projects as only editors should load codefixes.

expressed via `Assume.That`. Also nullable warnings are suppressed even in the context of the

`is null` and more general integer patterns as `is < 0 or >= 1`.

https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/Towards-NUnit4.html. The analyzers can help updating the
classic assert and fix the assert messages.

# NUnit Analyzers 3.7 (and 2.7) - September 16, 2023

This release contains a lot of improvements and corrections to the supression of non-nullable fields and properties
that are assigned in setup methods (and not in constructors). We have also added suppression of:

The release also contain some improvements to the performance of the analyzers by avoid repeated calls to 
GetTypeByMetadataName. Also ValuesAttribute is now also handled by the analyzer in a similar manner as TestCaseAttribute.
Most of the work done in this release have either been driven by or made by @manfred-brands.

This release of the NUnit Analyzers improves on the analysis of nullable reference types - in particular
in case of null coalescing operator and tuple deconstruction assignments.

The release also adds two new diagnostics for the TestCaseSource attribute. The diagnostics examines the test data returned
from the TestCaseSource:
* NUnit1029 - The number of parameters provided by the TestCaseSource does not match the number of parameters in the Test method
* NUnit1030 - The type of parameter provided by the TestCaseSource does not match the type of the parameter in the Test method

In addition, the release also contains some bug fixes to existing analyzers, and we have added a GitHub Actions workflow
and status badge.

# NUnit Analyzers 3.0 (and 2.0) - January 18, 2021

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds the possibility to suppress compiler errors based on context.
Initially, we support the suppression of errors arising from nullable reference types (many thanks to
Manfred Brands for this major contribution). This functionality depends on a newer version of Roslyn
which is not supported in Visual Studio 2017 (only in Visual Studio 2019).

So we have decided to release two versions of the analyzers: versions starting with 2.x can be used in Visual
Studio 2017 and versions starting with 3.x can be used in Visual Studio 2019 (the major version number matches
the major version number of Roslyn). Most features will be available in both the 2.x versions and the 3.x versions,
unless they require Roslyn functionality that is only available in the 3.x versions.

The release also contains some bugfixes to existing diagnostics.

* #336 Create a .NETStandard2.0 release


# NUnit Analyzers 0.6 - November 24, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers corrects several false positives from the analyzers.

We have also added a dependency on the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers package to help
us follow Roslyn best practices. The analyzer project is now multi-targeting to allow
us to better use Nullable Reference Types in the codebase.

# NUnit Analyzers 0.5 - September 30, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds three new diagnostics. One for ensuring that only test methods
are public in a test class, one disallowing the SameAs constraint on non-reference types, and one enforcing
that only compatible types are used in a comparison constraint. We have also extended several of the existing
diagnostics so that they apply to more cases.

Furthermore, we have significantly improved the performance of many of the existing diagnostics - inspired
by work done on the xunit.analyzers.

Finally, the documentation has been improved with additional information in the index and information about
configuration of the diagnostics using .editorconfig, and we have added StyleCop and FxCop analyzers
to enforce the coding standard.

# NUnit Analyzers 0.4 - July 25, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds 13 new diagnostics and codefixes for asserts in the classical model -
e.g. Assert.Greater, Assert.IsNotEmpty, Assert.IsNotInstanceOf etc. We have also improved the handling of
asserts against constants and variables of type Task.

In addition, we now properly handle ValueSourceAttribute and test methods decorated with both a
TestAttribute and a TestCaseSourceAttribute/TestCaseAttribute. We have also added a diagnostic and codefix
to ensure that test methods are public.
