NUnit Analyzers 3.0 (and 2.0) - January 18, 2021

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds the possibility to suppress compiler errors based on context.
Initially, we support the suppression of errors arising from nullable reference types (many thanks to
Manfred Brands for this major contribution). This functionality depends on a newer version of Roslyn
which is not supported in Visual Studio 2017 (only in Visual Studio 2019).

So we have decided to release two versions of the analyzers: versions starting with 2.x can be used in Visual
Studio 2017 and versions starting with 3.x can be used in Visual Studio 2019 (the major version number matches
the major version number of Roslyn). Most features will be available in both the 2.x versions and the 3.x versions,
unless they require Roslyn functionality that is only available in the 3.x versions.

The release also contains some bugfixes to existing diagnostics.

NUnit Analyzers 0.6 - November 24, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers corrects several false positives from the analyzers.

We have also added a dependency on the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers package to help
us follow Roslyn best practices. The analyzer project is now multi-targeting to allow
us to better use Nullable Reference Types in the codebase.

NUnit Analyzers 0.5 - September 30, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds three new diagnostics. One for ensuring that only test methods
are public in a test class, one disallowing the SameAs constraint on non-reference types, and one enforcing
that only compatible types are used in a comparison constraint. We have also extended several of the existing
diagnostics so that they apply to more cases.

Furthermore, we have significantly improved the performance of many of the existing diagnostics - inspired
by work done on the xunit.analyzers.

Finally, the documentation has been improved with additional information in the index and information about
configuration of the diagnostics using .editorconfig, and we have added StyleCop and FxCop analyzers
to enforce the coding standard.

NUnit Analyzers 0.4 - July 25, 2020

This release of the NUnit Analyzers adds 13 new diagnostics and codefixes for asserts in the classical model -
e.g. Assert.Greater, Assert.IsNotEmpty, Assert.IsNotInstanceOf etc. We have also improved the handling of
asserts against constants and variables of type Task.

In addition, we now properly handle ValueSourceAttribute and test methods decorated with both a
TestAttribute and a TestCaseSourceAttribute/TestCaseAttribute. We have also added a diagnostic and codefix
to ensure that test methods are public.
